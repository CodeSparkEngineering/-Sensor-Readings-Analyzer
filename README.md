## 🧩 Project Description
This program reads a user-defined number of sensor readings (or any numeric values), **dynamically allocates memory**, and then calculates and displays:

- The **average** of the readings  
- The **minimum** value recorded  
- The **maximum** value recorded  

It’s a simple example of **dynamic memory allocation**, **data processing**, and **basic statistical calculations** in C.
